		  column on the left, that's 3 columns wide so narrower than the other one. Columns offer a high degree of flexibility. In each row, you have access to 12 template columns, which means you can create various combinations of elements that span any number of columns. To define the width of a column, you use column classes that indicate the number of template columns it should occupy. For example, "col-4" spans four template columns. These widths are set in percentages, ensuring consistent relative sizing across different screen sizes.

				column on the right, that's twice as wide as the other one.  Rows are wrappers for columns.  Each column has horizontal padding, known as a gutter, which helps control the space between columns. To ensure the content within columns aligns visually on the left side, rows have negative margins. Additionally, rows offer modifier classes to apply consistent column sizing, and gutter classes to adjust the spacing of your content uniformly.
